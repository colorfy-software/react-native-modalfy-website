# Opening & closing

As soon as our modal stack is set up, we can start using it from wherever we want in the code. With Modal v2, we now have 3 different ways to do so, depending on the situation: 

**1.** If we're inside a regular component

**2.** If we're inside a modal component specifically

**3.** Or if we're just in plain JavaScript, outside React

## 1. From a regular component

#### [&gt; ModalProp API](../api/types/modalprop.md)

This use case could be the most frequent: we're in a regular component, could be a screen in our app for instance and we want to open a modal from there. To do so, we'll use the [**useModal\(\)**](../api/usemodal.md) Hooks \(or [**withModal\(\)**](../api/withmodal.md) HOC if we're dealing with a Class component\) to access the `modal` prop we saw in the previous section.

From there, amongst other things we'll cover later \(if you can't wait, check out [**ModalProp**](../api/types/modalprop.md) API reference\), we'll have access to the `openModal()` function:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="React JSX" %}
{% code title="./components/Message.js" %}
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native'
import { useModal } from 'react-native-modalfy'

const Message = () => {
  const { openModal, closeModal } = useModal()

  const sendMessage = () => openModal('MessageSentModal'))

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Just press send!</Text>
      <Button onPress={sendMessage} title="Send" />
    </View>
  )
}

export default Message

```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Have a look at [**ModalProp**](../api/types/modalprop.md) API reference to have a complete overview of what does `modal` brings with it. The most important thing to notice is that regular components \([**ModalProp**](../api/types/modalprop.md)\)  and modal components \([**ModalComponentProp**](../api/types/modalcomponentprop.md)\) do not have access to the same things inside `modal`.
{% endhint %}

## 2. From a modal component

#### [&gt; ModalComponentProp API](../api/types/modalcomponentprop.md)

Each component we put inside the `modalConfig` object we passed to `createModalStack()` will receive the `modal` prop. That's why we access it directly from the props, without the need of the Hooks/HOC:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="React JSX" %}
{% code title="./modals/MessageSentModal.js" %}
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native'

const MessageSentModal = ({ modal: { closeModal }}) => (
  <View>
    <Text>Your message was sent!</Text>
    <Button onPress={closeModal} title="OK" />
  </View>
)

export default MessageSentModal

```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You'll notice that to open a modal, Modalfy uses the keys we put inside `modalConfig`. So if the config looks like:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="React JSX" %}
{% code title="./App.js" %}
```jsx
import { ErrorModal, MessageSentModal } from './components/Modals'

const modalConfig = {
  NoConnection: ErrorModal,
  APITimeout: ErrorModal,
  TokenExpired: ErrorModal,
  MessageSentModal,
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

We can call `openModal('NoConnection')`, `openModal('MessageSentModal')`, etc.

## 3. From plain JavaScript

Modalfy v2 now allows us to interact with the modal stack from outside React. Possible use cases for this could be opening/closing modals from API calls or when there is a specific change in the global state, etc.
